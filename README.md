This library is currently under active development, so please avoid using any
of the exposed methods in projects that depend on any degree of upstream
stability!

## Description

This is a unique approach to the standard utility library, leveraging modern
meta-programming techniques now widely available in most JavaScript runtimes,
Micro brings to the table a huge reduction in the bundle size for any project
currently using Lodash, Ramda, or Underscore.

As well as the above, this project plays host to a collection of individually
packaged helpers, functional blocks, and generally useful knick-knacks that
often get repeated between projects.
